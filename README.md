# TidyTuesday
TidyTuesday is a weekly data project created by the R4DS learning community. Each week a new data set is chosen and participants practice data visualization, transformation, or modeling in R.

In this respository are a collection of my projects for this challenge. Finished visualizations are in the 'viz output' folder. For code, see the folder 'Weeks'.
